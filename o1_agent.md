## Abstract

With the increasing application of artificial intelligence in complex task processing, as well as the emergence of the OpenAI o1 model, how to effectively generate and utilize long-chain reasoning has become a key issue. This study proposes a system based on intelligent agents, aimed at autonomously generating and optimizing multi-step reasoning processes through an approach that does not fix the intermediate steps. Firstly, we directly use the original LLM (GPT4o) as a Process-based Reward Model (PRM) through prompts to evaluate the correctness and rationality of each step in the solution. Then, using different search strategies (such as tree search, beam search, etc.) combined with the language model (LLM), the agent independently decides on the strategy suitable for various tasks to most effectively solve the problem.
The innovation lies in that this method does not solidify the specific method of generating intermediate steps into one form of thought chain implementation, but instead allows the large language model (LLM) to explore and decide which thinking steps or problem-solving strategies to adopt. Since LLM can learn various search strategies including tree search and beam search. Also, this method uses the same LLM through prompts to precisely judge the correctness of the thought steps. Through this method, we constructed long thought chain training data like system 2 of human brain. Trained models similar to o1, enabling them to be more efficient and accurate in complex reasoning. Preliminary results show that this model's autonomous system for generating problem-solving strategies performs excellently in multi-step reasoning tasks, surpassing traditional CoT methods.
The main contribution: since there are many methods for solving complex problems, and tree search is not necessarily the best solution, allowing the LLM to autonomously learn existing various mathematical problem-solving methods enables the LLM to find more suitable problem-solving methods or strategies. Using the LLM itself as a reward model can effectively improve performance, because judging whether a solution is correct is usually simpler than generating the solution. This self-check method, similar to how humans scrutinize their own problem-solving processes, is always very beneficial, akin to the relationship between NP and P problems in computational complexity theory. This method relies entirely on the original LLM and can achieve self-evolution of the LLM through a continuous iterative process.
This research not only provides a new perspective for understanding and building AI systems with advanced cognitive functions but also opens new avenues for the self-optimization and evolution of LLMs. We expect this mechanism of self-reflection and self-evolution to play a greater role in future artificial intelligence research.

## Introduction

In the field of artificial intelligence, the capability to handle complex tasks effectively has become a cornerstone for developing advanced cognitive systems. With the advent of powerful models such as OpenAI's o1, there has been a significant shift in how these tasks are approached, particularly through the lens of long-chain reasoning. Long-chain reasoning, which involves the generation of extended sequences of reasoning steps, poses unique challenges and opportunities for AI systems. This paper introduces a novel intelligent agent-based system designed to autonomously generate and optimize multi-step reasoning processes without fixed intermediate steps.
Historically, AI systems have relied heavily on predefined strategies such as tree search or beam search to navigate complex problem spaces. However, these strategies often come with limitations in flexibility and adaptability, particularly when facing problems that do not conform to expected patterns or require novel reasoning pathways. The limitations of these conventional methods prompt the need for a more adaptive approach, one that can learn and evolve without human intervention.
The innovation in our approach lies in the integration of a large language model (LLM) with diverse strategies to autonomously work out the most effective problem-solving strategies. Instead of confining the reasoning process to specific strategies, the LLM explores and decides on the steps or strategies to employ. This capability is enhanced by the use of the LLM itself as a Process-based Reward Model (PRM), which evaluates the correctness and relevance of each reasoning step generated during the process.
Furthermore, our method capitalizes on the inherent ability of LLMs to learn and adapt various strategies, including but not limited to tree search and beam search. By leveraging the same LLM to both generate and evaluate reasoning steps via prompts, our system simulates a self-reflective process akin to human problem-solving, and expands a system 2 thinking style. This not only makes the reasoning process more robust but also allows for the continuous evolution of the LLMâ€™s capabilities through iterative refinement.
The contributions of this study are twofold. Firstly, we demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously learn and identify the most suitable strategies for complex problems, which is a significant departure from relying solely on traditional tree search methods. Secondly, the use of the LLM as a reward model enhances performance by simplifying the task of evaluating solutions compared to generating them, a concept reminiscent of the relationship between NP and P problems in computational complexity theory.
This research not only provides new insights into the construction of advanced AI systems with high-level cognitive functions but also opens new pathways for the self-optimization and evolution of LLMs. We anticipate that the mechanisms of self-reflection and self-evolution proposed in this study will play a crucial role in the future of AI research.

## Background and Related Work

### Large Language Models in Reasoning Tasks

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and its successors have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, comprehension, and reasoning. These models, trained on diverse and expansive corpora, possess a broad understanding of human language and a nuanced ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Notably, their application in reasoning tasks has shown promising results, particularly in generating explanations and solving complex multi-step problems through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while LLMs excel in generating plausible reasoning chains, the challenge remains in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of these chains over extended interactions and complex scenarios.

### Existing Approaches to Long-Chain Reasoning

Traditional approaches to long-chain reasoning in AI have primarily focused on structured methods such as tree search and beam search. These methods, while effective in constrained environments, often do not scale well with the ambiguity and open-endedness typical of real-world problems. For instance, tree search strategies can explore an immense number of potential paths, but they are computationally expensive and may not always converge on the most logical or concise solution path. Beam search, while more focused by limiting the breadth of exploration, can miss potentially correct solutions by prematurely narrowing the search space.

### Self-Optimizing Systems in AI

The concept of self-optimizing systems, which are capable of improving their performance autonomously over time, is not new in the field of AI. These systems typically rely on reinforcement learning techniques where an agent learns from interactions with the environment to maximize a certain reward function. The self-optimization aspect of such systems has been explored in various contexts, including robotic navigation and automated game playing, where the system iteratively adjusts its strategies based on the outcomes of past actions. However, applying self-optimization to the domain of AI reasoning, particularly with LLMs, introduces unique challenges and opportunities. It requires not just the ability to adjust strategies but also to refine the underlying reasoning processes that the model employs.

### Limitations of Current Models
Despite the advances made with LLMs and other AI systems, there remain significant gaps in their ability to autonomously generate and refine long-chain reasoning processes. Current models often require substantial human intervention, whether in the form of pre-defined prompts or structured problem-solving frameworks, to effectively tackle complex reasoning tasks. This dependence limits the scalability and adaptability of AI systems in dynamic environments.

## Methodology
### System Architecture
The core of our proposed system is an intelligent agent that leverages a large language model (LLM) equipped with a Process-based Reward Model (PRM). The system architecture is designed to facilitate autonomous generation and optimization of reasoning strategies across various tasks. It consists of the following key components:

Intelligent Agent: Acts as the central executor, employing the LLM to generate, evaluate, and iteratively refine reasoning steps.

Process-based Reward Model (PRM): Embedded within the LLM, this model evaluates each reasoning step based on correctness and relevance, providing feedback that guides the learning and strategy adaptation process.

Strategy Selector: Utilizes dynamic search strategies like tree search and beam search, enabling the agent to adapt its approach based on the complexity and requirements of the task.

### Planning and Decomposition
The intelligent agent begins by analyzing the userâ€™s question and decomposing it into a series of sub-problems. This initial planning phase is critical as it sets the framework for the reasoning process:

Problem Decomposition: The agent breaks down the main question into manageable sub-problems, each representing a key piece of the overall puzzle.

Initial Plan Formulation: It formulates an initial plan of attack, determining the order and method for addressing each sub-problem.

### Iterative Problem Solving
Once the initial plan is in place, the agent begins the iterative problem-solving process:

Addressing the First Sub-Problem: The agent tackles the first sub-problem using a selected reasoning strategy. This step is crucial as it sets the foundation for subsequent reasoning.

Result Evaluation and Plan Update: Following the resolution of a sub-problem, the PRM assesses the solutionâ€™s correctness and relevance. Based on this feedback, the agent updates the plan, reordering or adjusting the remaining steps as necessary.

Iterative Refinement: This process of solving a sub-problem, evaluating results, and updating the plan continues iteratively. Each cycle refines the agentâ€™s approach and brings it closer to a comprehensive solution to the userâ€™s question.

### Strategy Selection and Adjustment
Throughout the reasoning process, the strategy selector plays a pivotal role by dynamically choosing the most appropriate reasoning strategy for each sub-problem:

Dynamic Strategy Application: Depending on the nature of the sub-problem, different strategies (e.g., tree search, beam search, or custom strategies) may be employed to optimize the solution path.

Continuous Learning and Adaptation: As the agent progresses, it learns from the outcomes of previous sub-problems which strategies yield the best results, allowing for smarter adjustments in real-time.

### Self-Optimization Through PRM

The PRM plays a critical role in our system's ability to self-optimize. It operates by evaluating the outputs generated by the LLM during the reasoning process. Feedback from the PRM is used to adjust the strategies employed by the agent, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the reasoning process. This feedback loop enables the agent to learn from its experiences, refining its approach continuously:

Feedback Mechanism: After executing a reasoning step, the PRM provides feedback based on the step's effectiveness.

Strategy Adjustment: Based on the feedback, the agent adjusts its reasoning strategies, improving future responses.

Iterative Learning: This process repeats, allowing the system to evolve and adapt to new challenges and complexities over time.  ### Evaluation of Reasoning Steps
To ensure the quality of the reasoning process, each step generated by the agent is rigorously evaluated. This evaluation is twofold:

Correctness Assessment: The PRM assesses whether the reasoning steps logically follow from one another and are factually correct.

Relevance Verification: It also verifies that each step is relevant to the task at hand, ensuring that the agent remains focused on the problem.  ## System Implementation

### Evaluation of Reasoning Steps
The implementation of our intelligent agent system revolves around a structured and iterative approach to problem-solving. This section outlines the technical details and operational workflow of our system, highlighting the key components involved in the process.

### Initial Problem Analysis and Decomposition
Upon receiving a user's query, the first task for the intelligent agent is to conduct an initial analysis to understand the complexity and requirements of the query. This analysis leads to the decomposition of the query into a series of manageable sub-problems, each representing a critical element that contributes to the overall solution.

Query Parsing: The system uses natural language processing techniques to parse and interpret the query, identifying key themes and requirements.

Decomposition Algorithm: A custom algorithm is employed to break down the main query into sub-problems. This algorithm considers various factors such as the logical dependencies between parts of the query and the complexity of each segment.  ### Solving the First Sub-Problem
With the sub-problems defined, the agent proceeds to address them sequentially, starting with the first one. This step is crucial as it sets the initial direction for the reasoning process.

Strategy Application: Depending on the nature of the sub-problem, an appropriate reasoning strategy is selected from a pool that includes tree search, beam search, and others. The selection is based on the predicted effectiveness for the specific type of sub-problem.

Solution Generation: The agent uses the selected strategy to generate potential solutions. This process is facilitated by the LLM, which provides a reasoning framework based on trained models.  ### Dynamic Plan Updating and Iterative Solution Refinement
After solving the first sub-problem, the agent evaluates the outcome and uses this information to update the plan for addressing the remaining sub-problems. This iterative cycle enhances the solutionâ€™s accuracy and relevance.

Feedback Integration: The Process-based Reward Model (PRM) evaluates the solution to the first sub-problem, providing feedback on its correctness and relevance. This feedback is crucial for refining further steps.

Plan Update Mechanism: Based on the feedback, the agent updates the strategy for the subsequent sub-problems. This may involve reordering the sub-problems, modifying the strategies, or even revisiting the decomposition if necessary.  
### Continuous Problem Solving Loop
The agent continues to apply this iterative process to each sub-problem, dynamically adjusting its approach based on the latest feedback and insights gained from previous steps.

Iterative Solving: For each sub-problem, the agent repeats the process of strategy selection, solution generation, and feedback integration.

Continuous Learning: Throughout the process, the system learns from each iteration, which improves its performance on similar tasks in the future.

### System Integration and Testing
To ensure the systemâ€™s robustness and reliability, it undergoes rigorous testing:

Integration Testing: Components of the system are tested together to ensure they work seamlessly in real-time scenarios.

Performance Evaluation: The system is evaluated on various benchmark tasks to assess its reasoning abilities and the effectiveness of its iterative learning capabilities.  ## Experimental Design and Results Analysis

Our experiments were designed to compare the performance of traditional LLM reasoning chains with our agent's long-chain reasoning outputs.

Dataset Selection: Approximately 40,000 mathematical problem entries from the NuminaMath-CoT dataset were selected as the base for this study.

Long-Chain Reasoning Generation: Using our intelligent agent system, we generated long-chain reasoning sequences for these problems. The agentâ€™s task was to decompose each problem, solve the sub-problems iteratively, and build a comprehensive reasoning chain.

Data Filtering Using the Reward Model: The PRM was employed to evaluate the correctness of the generated answers. Incorrect entries were filtered out, resulting in a final dataset of approximately 21,000 correctly solved problems with their corresponding reasoning chains.  ### Comparative Experimental Groups

## Discussion
### Enhanced Problem-Solving with Long-Chain Reasoning
The experimental results indicate that long-chain reasoning sequences generated by our intelligent agent system significantly improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. The primary advantage of our system is its ability to dynamically generate, evaluate, and optimize reasoning steps based on continuous feedback. This process not only ensures a high degree of correctness but also enhances the relevance and logical flow of the reasoning chains.

Autonomy in Reasoning: Our agentâ€™s autonomous generation of reasoning steps represents a shift from static, predefined reasoning patterns to a more flexible, adaptive approach. This autonomy allows for customized reasoning paths that are better suited to specific problems, demonstrating a significant improvement over traditional CoT methodologies.
